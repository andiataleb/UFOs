# UFOs

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project is to help Dana to become familiar with JavaScript coding language to eventually create a table with the ability of filtering the UFO sightings data, that is stored in JavaScript array, based on different criteria such as Date, City, State, Country and more. She wants to build a dynamic webpage to let the readers enter different inputs to filter through the available UFO sightings data. Therefore, she needed to creat the table into an HTML file so it can be viewed and accessed through her webpage.


## Results
 Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
 
For a viewer of this new webpage, the data can be filtered by entering criteria that they are interested in the designated location. Based on the picture below, readers can filter the table based on date, city, state, country and shape.
