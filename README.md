# UFOs

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project is to help Dana to become familiar with JavaScript coding language to eventually create a table with the ability to filtering the UFO sightings data, that is stored in a JavaScript array, based on different criteria such as Date, City, State, and more. She wants to build a dynamic webpage to let the readers enter different inputs to filter through the available UFO sightings data. Therefore, she needed to create the table into an HTML file so it can be viewed and accessed through her webpage.


## Results
 For a viewer of this new webpage, the data can be filtered by entering criteria that they are interested in the designated box. Based on the picture below, readers can filter the table based on date, city, state, country, and shape. After entering the input, the output table will be updated after a click anywhere on the webpage.

## Summary

### Drawback

One drawback of this new design is that there is no button to update the results.

### Recommendations
One recommendation is to add a filter button to make the webpage more user-friendly. In addition, having a dropdown list to know the different options for each filter would be a nice feature.
